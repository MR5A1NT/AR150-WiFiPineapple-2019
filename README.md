# AR-150 WiFi Pineapple NANO

Converting your AR-150 to a WiFi Pineapple NANO should be an easy process.  However, the web & git is full of broken bin images and botched firmware builders... resulting in a broken or partially-working firmware.  The latest working build available elsewhere is 2.4.2.  Here, we start with version 2.5.4.

Summary:
1. Rootfs 2.6M
2. PineAP(d) working.
3. Drivers for: kmod-rt2800, kmod-rtl8187 and kmod-rtl8192cu (TL-WN7200ND, AWUS036H, based on RT5370, etc)
4. Kernel 3.18.84
